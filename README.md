# 🌦️ Weather Data Analyzer

# 📌 Project Overview

The Weather Data Analyzer project demonstrates how to use NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to:

Load and clean a weather dataset.

Perform statistical analysis (average temperature, hottest/coldest day, humidity trends).

Visualize weather patterns using line charts, histograms, and bar charts.

Export the cleaned dataset for reporting.

This project is designed to practice data cleaning, exploration, and visualization skills.

# 📂 Dataset Information

**Source:** Daily Weather Dataset – Kaggle

**Columns Used:**

**Formatted Date →** Date of observation

**TemperatureC →** Temperature in °C

**Humidity →** Humidity level (%)

**Wind SpeedKm/h →** Wind speed in Km/h

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

NumPy for numerical analysis

Pandas for data cleaning & manipulation

Matplotlib for visualization

# 📑 Analysis Performed

✔️ Cleaned missing values in temperature and humidity
✔️ Converted date column to datetime and extracted Year/Month
✔️ Found hottest and coldest days
✔️ Calculated average temperature and humidity using NumPy
✔️ Exported cleaned dataset to cleaned_weather.csv

# 📊 Visualizations

The project includes multiple plots for insights:

**📈 Line Chart →** Daily temperature trend

**📉 Histogram →** Humidity distribution

**📊 Bar Chart →** Average monthly temperature
